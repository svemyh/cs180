# Colorizing Historic Photos
This project revives color in historic photos taken by Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii, a visionary who captured the Russian Empire in color long before modern color photography existed. Using his unique method of capturing three images through red, green, and blue filters, we reconstruct his historic black-and-white images into vibrant color photos.
